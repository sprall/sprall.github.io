<p>I am an Assistant Professor and evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Missouri with interests in human health and reproduction, reproductive decision making, and evolutionary ecology. In particular I examine costs and trade-offs associated with investments in reproduction. I do this with a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including anthropometrics, demography, endocrinology, actigraphy, validated health surveys, dyadic peer ratings, alongside semi-structured demographic interviews and measures of social norms. Iâ€™m currently working on an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2317312&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF funded project</a> to examine individual, economic, and cultural factors that mediate vaccination decisions. I co-direct the <a href="http://krhdp.weebly.com">Kunene Rural Health and Demography Project</a>, and am a contributor to the <a href="https://endowproject.github.io">ENDOW project</a>, a collaborator on the <a href="https://kathrinestarkweather.com/research-1">Shodagor Longitudinal Health and Demography Project</a>, and a board member on the <a href="https://www.onepencilproject.org">One Pencil Project</a>.</p>

<li><strong>Anthro 1000 - <a href="pubs/Prall_Anthro1000.pdf">Introduction to anthropology: biology, prehistory, and culture</a></strong> - Anthropology is the study of humanity. As such, anthropology seeks to understand where humans come from and how they have evolved, how societies and cultures develop and change over time, and to understand modern cultural and behavioral diversity. Because of this broad approach, anthropology is inherently an interdisciplinary field, drawing from social and natural sciences, history, and linguistics. By combining these perspectives, with an emphasis on diversity and cultural variation, anthropology helps us understand how people live, adapt, and shape the world around them. <a href="pubs/Prall_Anthro1000.pdf">syllabus</a></li>
<li><strong>Anthro 1560 - <a href="pubs/Prall_outbreaks_syllabus.pdf">Outbreaks and the anthropology of emerging disease</a></strong> - Human-environment interactions, and biocultural responses to illness profoundly impact the ways in which diseases evolve, emerge, and spread. Similarly, cultural responses to disease processes can have profound impacts on the evolution of cultural traits. This course will explore the role of humans and cultural variation in emerging infectious diseases and disease outbreaks by focusing on the origins, emergence, spread, and response to Ebola, Rabies, HIV, COVID-19 and others. Additionally this course will explore the cultural evolution of resistance to treatment of infectious disease, including vaccine hesitancy in industrialized and developing countries, as well as stigma, misinformation, and distrust that often accompanies disease outbreaks. By focusing on the interplay between culture and ecology, this course will highlight the power of anthropological perspectives to understand human health in the context of contemporary infectious diseases. <a href="pubs/Prall_outbreaks_syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a></li>
<li><strong>Anthro 2580 - <a href="pubs/Prall_sex_syllabus.pdf">Evolution of Human Sexuality</a></strong> - Sexual reproduction has been shaped by two billion years of evolution. In the human lineage, we carry biological and behavioral remnants of this evolution, but our own reproductive behaviors and decisions are also influenced by the cultural context. Ecology and social life shape variation in mating patterns cross-culturally, including sexual behavior, marriage, attraction, mate choice, jealousy, paternity, disease transmission, contraception, and interpretations of gender. By drawing from evolutionary history, non-human primates, small-scale societies, and industrialized nations, this course will critically evaluate understandings of human sexual behavior and reproduction from an evolutionary and anthropological perspective. <a href="pubs/Prall_sex_syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a></li>
<li><strong>Anthro 4300/7300 - <a href="pubs/Prall_comp_social_org_syllabus.pdf">Comparative Social Organization</a></strong> - This course explores the variation in social organization as studied by anthropologists. As part of this course, students will explore topics including kinship, marriage, family, decent and residence patterns, social networks, inequality, and the evolutionary and ecological approaches to understanding these topics. In the first part of the course, we will explore important concepts of kinship, decent, and residence, and marriage. The second part of the course will survey major patterns of social organization from both regional, historical, and topical perspectives. As part of this course students will read and analyze ethnographic descriptions of various populations, watch documentaries, and engage in discussions of course topics. By the end of the course students will have an understanding of how gender and kinship shape social structures and institutions. <a href="pubs/Prall_comp_social_org_syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a></li>
<li><strong>Anthro 4580/7580 - <a href="pubs/Prall_evmed_syllabus.pdf">Evolutionary Medicine</a></strong> - Evolutionary processes and human evolutionary history have profound implications in the way in which we respond and are susceptible to disease. Unlike many biomedical understandings of human health, evolution can better inform on the ultimate causes and consequences of topics such as infection and inflammation, allergy, parasites, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, aging, reproductive issues, and mental disorders. As part of this class, students will use evolution to critically evaluate human health, and explore how natural selection can shape behaviors and physiological responses. <a href="pubs/Prall_evmed_syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a></li>
